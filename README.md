# UC1 — Feet Equality (TDD Implementation)

## Goal

Implement equality comparison between two Feet measurements using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

This is the first incremental step toward building a scalable Quantity Measurement system.

---

# Development Approach

This feature strictly follows the TDD cycle:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor without breaking tests

All logic was test-driven before implementation.

---

# Tests Implemented

The equality contract was validated with the following cases:

- Same value should return true
- Different value should return false
- Null comparison should return false
- Comparison with different object type should return false
- Same reference should return true

---

# Implementation Details

Created a Feet class with:

- A value field
- Overridden equals() method
- Proper equality contract handling

The implementation ensures:

- Reflexive behavior
- Symmetric comparison
- Consistency
- Null safety
- Type safety

---

# Learning Outcomes

- Clear understanding of Java equals() contract
- Practical application of Test-Driven Development
- Writing minimal, clean implementation code
- Maintaining code safety through refactoring
- Following structured Git feature branch workflow
