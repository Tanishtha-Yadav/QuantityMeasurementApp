# Quantity Measurement App

## Project Overview

The Quantity Measurement App is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) based project designed to build scalable and maintainable measurement comparison logic step by step.

The system currently supports equality comparison for multiple length units while following:

* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Incremental Development
* Clean Code Principles
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* Structured Git Workflow

Development progresses through small, focused Use Cases (UCs), ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

---

## Development Methodology

This project follows the TDD cycle:

1. Write failing tests
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor safely

This guarantees:

* Safety
* Maintainability
* Controlled growth of complexity

---

## Git Workflow

* main → stable production code
* dev → integration branch
* feature/UCx-* → feature-specific branches

Each use case was developed independently and merged after validation.

---

---

## Refactored Architecture & Conversion Support (UC3–UC5)

This phase of the project focuses on refactoring, extensibility, and explicit unit conversion while maintaining full Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline.

The design evolved from unit-specific classes to a scalable and extensible measurement system.

---

# UC3 — Refactor to Generic Length Model

## Goal

Eliminate duplication and introduce a generic, scalable design.

## Refactoring Performed

Removed:

* Feet class
* Inches class

Introduced:

* `Length` class
* `LengthUnit` enum

## Core Design

Instead of separate classes for each unit:

Length(value, LengthUnit)

## Base Unit Strategy

All measurements are internally converted to a common base unit: **Inches**

Conversion rules:

* FEET → 12 inches
* INCHES → 1 inch

Added:

convertToBaseUnit()

* Inches equals Inches
* 1 Foot equals 12 Inches
* Symmetry validation
* Transitive equality
* Full equals contract validation

## Learning

* Safe refactoring using tests
* Generic domain modeling
* DRY principle implementation

---

# UC4 — Extensibility with New Units

## Goal

Validate that the architecture supports adding new units without modifying core logic.

## Units Added

* YARDS
* CENTIMETERS

Only the `LengthUnit` enum was updated.
No changes were made to equality logic.

## Conversion Factors

| Unit         | Inches Equivalent |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 Foot       | 12                |
| 1 Yard       | 36                |
| 1 Inch       | 1                 |
| 1 Centimeter | 0.393701          |

## Tests Added

* Yard equals Yard

---

# UC6 — Addition of Two Length Units (Same Category)

## Goal

Extend the Quantity Measurement API to support addition between two length measurements, even if they belong to different units, while returning the result in the unit of the first operand.

This use case builds on UC5’s conversion infrastructure.

---

## Core Feature

Add two `Length` objects:

QuantityLength.add(length1, length2)

or

length1.add(length2)

Result:

* Returned in the unit of the first operand
* Original objects remain unchanged (immutability preserved)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Validation

* Both operands must be non-null
* Units must be valid
* Values must be finite (not NaN or infinite)

### Conversion Flow

1. Convert both operands to base unit (Feet)
2. Perform addition
3. Convert result back to unit of first operand
4. Return new Length instance

---

## Key Concepts Applied

* Arithmetic operations on value objects
* Reuse of base-unit conversion strategy
* Immutability principle
* Open/Closed compliance
* Commutativity validation
* Identity element validation
* Floating-point precision handling

---

## Test Coverage

### Same Unit Addition

* 1 Foot + 2 Feet = 3 Feet
* 6 Inches + 6 Inches = 12 Inches

### Cross-Unit Addition

* 1 Foot + 12 Inches = 2 Feet
* 12 Inches + 1 Foot = 24 Inches
* 1 Yard + 3 Feet = 2 Yards
* 2.54 cm + 1 Inch ≈ 5.08 cm

### Mathematical Properties

* Commutativity (A + B = B + A)
* Identity (adding zero returns same value)
* Negative values supported
* Large & small magnitude validation

### Error Handling

* Null operand throws exception
* Invalid unit handling
* NaN and infinite validation

---

## Example Outputs

add(Quantity(1.0, FEET), Quantity(12.0, INCHES))
→ Quantity(2.0, FEET)

add(Quantity(12.0, INCHES), Quantity(1.0, FEET))
→ Quantity(24.0, INCHES)

add(Quantity(5.0, FEET), Quantity(0.0, INCHES))
→ Quantity(5.0, FEET)

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Extending domain model with arithmetic operations
* Leveraging abstraction for reuse
* Maintaining immutability
* Handling precision in floating-point arithmetic
* Designing mathematically consistent APIs

---

# Quantity Measurement App

## UC7 – Addition with Explicit Target Unit Specification

### Overview

UC7 extends the addition functionality introduced in UC6 by allowing the caller to explicitly specify the target unit for the result.

Instead of defaulting the result to the unit of the first operand, UC7 provides:

add(length1, length2, targetUnit)

This ensures greater flexibility, clarity, and API consistency.

Example:

add(1 FEET, 12 INCHES, YARDS) → ~0.667 YARDS

---

## Objective

Provide explicit control over the unit in which the addition result should be expressed.

---

## Preconditions

* Length class exists (from UC3–UC6)
* LengthUnit enum includes:

  * FEET
  * INCHES
  * YARDS
  * CENTIMETERS
* All units share a consistent base unit (FEET)
* Inputs are valid Length objects
* Target unit is explicitly provided

---

## Core Flow

1. Validate:

   * length1 and length2 are non-null
   * targetUnit is non-null
   * Values are finite numbers
   * Units belong to same measurement category

2. Convert both operands to base unit (FEET)

3. Add base values

4. Convert result to explicitly specified targetUnit

5. Return new immutable Length object

---

## Postconditions

* Result is always returned in the specified target unit
* Original operands remain unchanged (immutability preserved)
* Addition remains commutative
* Invalid inputs throw IllegalArgumentException
* Accuracy maintained within floating-point tolerance

---

## Example Results

add(1 FEET, 12 INCHES, FEET) → 2 FEET
add(1 FEET, 12 INCHES, INCHES) → 24 INCHES
add(1 FEET, 12 INCHES, YARDS) → ~0.667 YARDS
add(2 YARDS, 3 FEET, FEET) → 9 FEET
add(5 FEET, -2 FEET, INCHES) → 36 INCHES

---

## Concepts Applied

* Method Overloading (implicit + explicit addition)
* Explicit parameter passing
* Base-unit conversion strategy
* DRY principle via private utility method
* API consistency
* Functional programming style (pure method behavior)
* Immutability and thread-safety
* Commutative property validation
* Precision handling with epsilon comparison

---

## Key Test Coverage

* Explicit target same as first operand
* Explicit target same as second operand
* Explicit target different from operands
* Cross-scale conversions (large → small, small → large)
* Zero and negative values
* Null target unit validation
* Commutativity with explicit target
* Precision tolerance across conversions
* All unit combination coverage

---

## Learning Outcome

UC7 demonstrates:

* Flexible API design
* Caller intent clarity
* Scalable arithmetic abstraction
* Clean extension without breaking previous UCs
* Strong validation discipline
* Unit-independent arithmetic operations

---

## UC8 – Refactoring LengthUnit to Standalone Enum

### Overview

UC8 focuses on architectural refactoring by extracting the `LengthUnit` enum from inside the `Length` class and making it a standalone top-level enum.

This improves separation of concerns and aligns the design with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

All functionality from UC1 through UC7 continues to work without modification.

---

## Objective

Refactor the design to:

* Separate unit behavior from measurement logic
* Improve scalability for future measurement categories
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Preserve all existing functionality

---

## What Was Refactored

### Before UC8

* `LengthUnit` enum was nested inside the `Length` class
* Conversion logic partially handled inside `Length`

### After UC8

* `LengthUnit` moved to its own file (standalone enum)
* All conversion logic moved into `LengthUnit`
* `Length` now delegates conversion responsibilities
* Circular dependency risk removed

---

## Design Improvements

### Separation of Responsibilities

* `Length` → Handles:

  * equality
  * conversion delegation
  * addition (UC6 & UC7)
* `LengthUnit` → Handles:

  * convertToBaseUnit()
  * convertFromBaseUnit()

---

## Benefits Achieved

* Cleaner architecture
* Better SRP compliance
* Easier to extend for:

  * Weight
  * Volume
  * Temperature
* Improved readability & maintainability
* No breaking changes
* All previous UC tests pass successfully

---

## Technical Highlights

* No API changes
* No behavior changes
* Full backward compatibility
* Improved modular design
* Enhanced scalability

---

## Learning Outcome

UC8 demonstrates:

* Refactoring with safety using TDD
* Architectural evolution without breaking functionality
* Clean separation of domain logic
* Preparing codebase for multi-measurement support

---

## UC9 – Addition of Weight Measurement

### Overview

UC9 extends the Quantity Measurement App by introducing a new measurement category: **Weight**.

Until UC8, the system supported only **Length** measurements.
UC9 expands the architecture to support **multiple independent measurement categories** while preserving type safety and immutability.

---

## Objective

Introduce weight measurement support with:

* Equality comparison
* Unit conversion
* Addition operations
* Explicit target unit addition
* Category type safety

---

## Supported Weight Units

| Unit          | Base Conversion    |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Kilogram (kg) | Base unit          |
| Gram (g)      | 1 kg = 1000 g      |
| Pound (lb)    | 1 lb = 0.453592 kg |

---

## Features Implemented

### 1️⃣ Equality Comparison

Weight objects can be compared across units.

Examples:

* 1 kg == 1000 g
* 2.20462 lb == 1 kg

---

### 2️⃣ Unit Conversion

Supports conversion across all weight units:

* kg → g
* g → lb
* lb → kg

Round-trip conversion maintains precision.

---

### 3️⃣ Addition Operations

Two weights can be added:

* Result returned in first operand unit
* Result returned in explicitly specified target unit

Examples:

* 1 kg + 1000 g = 2 kg
* 1 kg + 1000 g (GRAM) = 2000 g

---

### 4️⃣ Category Type Safety

Length and Weight are independent categories.

Invalid comparisons are prevented.

Example:

* 1 kg ≠ 1 foot

Cross-category operations throw validation exceptions.

---

### 5️⃣ Immutability & Precision

* All operations return new objects
* No mutation of existing instances
* Floating-point precision maintained
* Supports zero, negative, and large values

---

## Architectural Impact

## UC10 – Generic Quantity Measurement using Interface & Generics

### Overview

UC10 introduces a major architectural refactor by converting the system into a **generic, reusable measurement framework** using **interfaces and generics**.

The application now supports multiple measurement domains (Length and Weight) through a unified abstraction.

This significantly improves scalability, maintainability, and code reuse.

---

## Objective

Design a flexible measurement system that:

* Supports multiple unit categories
* Eliminates duplication
* Preserves type safety

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1️⃣ Common Interface – `IMeasurable`

Created a shared interface to standardize unit behavior.

Responsibilities:

* convertToBaseUnit()
* convertFromBaseUnit()
* Unit name access

This enables any future unit type (Temperature, Volume, etc.) to integrate seamlessly.

---

### 2️⃣ Refactored Unit Enums

Both enums now implement `IMeasurable`:

* LengthUnit
* WeightUnit

Each unit defines:

* Base conversion factor
* Conversion logic

This centralizes conversion behavior inside the unit itself.

---

### 3️⃣ Generic Quantity Class

Introduced a reusable generic class:

```
Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>
```

Capabilities:

* Cross-unit equality comparison
* Unit conversion
* Addition (default result unit)
* Addition with explicit target unit
* Input validation
* Immutable design

This removes duplication across Length and Weight logic.

---

### 4️⃣ Multi-Domain Support

System now supports:

* Length conversions and arithmetic
* Weight conversions and arithmetic

Both domains share the same generic infrastructure.

---

### 5️⃣ Test Coverage

Added 30+ unit tests covering:

* Enum conversion logic
* Equality checks
* Conversion operations
* Addition operations
* Explicit target unit addition
* Null & invalid inputs
* HashCode consistency
* Immutability
* Backward compatibility

---

## Architectural Impact

* Generic domain modeling

* Elimination of measurement-specific duplication
* Scalable design for future measurement types
* Clean separation of concerns

---

## Key Concepts Applied

* Generics with bounded types

* Domain abstraction
* Reusable arithmetic logic

---

## Learning Outcome

UC10 demonstrates:

* Advanced refactoring using TDD

* Strong compile-time type safety
* Clean API design for measurement systems

---

## UC11 – Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition

### Branch: `feature/UC11-VolumeMeasurement`

---

## Objective

Extend the generic architecture introduced in UC10 to support a third measurement category: **Volume**.

Supported units:

* LITRE (Base Unit)
* MILLILITRE (1 L = 1000 mL)
* GALLON (1 gal ≈ 3.78541 L)

No changes were made to:

* `Quantity<U>`
* `IMeasurable`
* `QuantityMeasurementApp`
* Existing test infrastructure

This validates that the architecture scales seamlessly.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created `VolumeUnit` Enum

`VolumeUnit` implements `IMeasurable` and defines:

* getConversionFactor()
* convertToBaseUnit(double value)
* convertFromBaseUnit(double baseValue)
* getUnitName()

Conversion factors (base unit: LITRE):

* LITRE → 1.0
* MILLILITRE → 0.001
* GALLON → 3.78541

---

### 2. Equality Support

Verified:

* 1 L = 1000 mL
* 1 gallon ≈ 3.78541 L
* Symmetry & transitive properties
* Cross-category comparison returns false

---

### 3. Unit Conversion

Tested:

* L → mL
* mL → L
* L → gallon
* gallon → L
* Round-trip conversions
* Zero, negative, and large values

---

### 4. Addition Operations

Supported:

* Same-unit addition
* Cross-unit addition
* Explicit target unit specification
* Commutativity
* Precision handling

Examples:

* 1 L + 1000 mL → 2 L
* 3.78541 L + 1 gallon → ~2 gallons
* Explicit conversion to millilitre or gallon

---

### 5. Category Isolation

Confirmed:

* Volume cannot be compared with Length
* Volume cannot be compared with Weight
* Generic type safety enforced at compile time
* Runtime safety check in equals()

---

## Key Architectural Validation

UC11 proves:

* Generic `<U extends IMeasurable>` design scales linearly
* New measurement categories require only a new enum
* DRY principle maintained
* Open/Closed Principle achieved
* Zero modification to core engine

Architecture is now validated for future categories such as:

* Temperature
* Time
* Area
* Speed

---

## Test Coverage

Covered:

* Litre ↔ Litre
* Millilitre ↔ Millilitre
* Gallon ↔ Gallon
* Cross-unit equality
* Conversion accuracy
* Addition (implicit & explicit unit)
* Null handling
* Precision tolerance
* Backward compatibility (UC1–UC10)

All previous use cases remain fully functional.

---

## Learning Outcome

* Scalable generic architecture
* Enum-based polymorphism
* Interface-driven design
* Floating-point precision management
* Category-safe generics
* Immutable quantity model

---

## UC12 – Subtraction and Division Operations

### Branch: `feature/UC12-Subtraction-Division`

Project Link:

---

## Objective

Extend the generic `Quantity<U>` architecture to support:

* Subtraction between quantities
* Division between quantities (dimensionless ratio)

This enhancement builds on UC1–UC11 (equality, conversion, addition) without modifying the core architecture.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Subtraction

Added two overloaded methods:

```java
subtract(Quantity<U> other)
subtract(Quantity<U> other, U targetUnit)
```

Behavior:

* Converts both operands to base unit
* Performs subtraction
* Converts result to implicit (first operand) or explicit target unit
* Rounds to two decimal places
* Returns new immutable `Quantity<U>`

Supported:

* Same-unit subtraction
* Cross-unit subtraction (within same category)
* Explicit target unit specification
* Negative results
* Zero results
* Chained subtraction

Cross-category subtraction throws `IllegalArgumentException`.

---

### 2. Division

Added:

```java
divide(Quantity<U> other)
```

Behavior:

* Converts operands to base unit
* Divides base values
* Returns dimensionless `double`
* Prevents division by zero (throws `ArithmeticException`)

Supported:

* Same-unit division
* Cross-unit division (within same category)
* Ratio > 1
* Ratio < 1
* Ratio = 1
* Large and small magnitude values

Cross-category division throws `IllegalArgumentException`.

---

## Mathematical Properties Verified

* Subtraction is non-commutative
* Division is non-commutative
* Division is non-associative
* Addition/subtraction inverse relationship validated
* Immutability preserved

---

## Validation & Error Handling

Handled:

* Null operands
* Null target units
* NaN / infinite values
* Division by zero
* Cross-category operations
* Precision rounding (subtraction only)

---

## Scalability

Subtraction and division work across:

* Length
* Weight
* Volume

No architectural changes were required.

The generic `<U extends IMeasurable>` design continues to scale cleanly.

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Full arithmetic support in domain model
* Non-commutative operation handling
* Fail-fast validation patterns
* Consistent method overloading design
* Precision management across arithmetic operations
* Preservation of SOLID and immutability principles

---

# Quantity Measurement App

## UC13 – Centralized Arithmetic Logic (DRY Refactor)

### Branch: `feature/UC13-Centralized-Arithmetic-Logic`

---

## Objective

Refactor arithmetic operations (add, subtract, divide) introduced in UC12 to eliminate code duplication and enforce the **DRY principle**.

Public API remains unchanged.
All UC12 behaviors are preserved.
All existing test cases pass without modification.

---

## Problem in UC12

UC12 had repeated logic in:

* add()
* subtract()
* divide()

Each method repeated:

* Null validation
* Category compatibility checks
* Finiteness checks
* Base-unit conversion
* Target unit handling

This violated:

* DRY principle
* Maintainability standards
* Scalability for future operations

---

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Introduced `ArithmeticOperation` Enum

Enum-based operation dispatch:

* ADD
* SUBTRACT
* DIVIDE

Each constant defines computation logic via:

* Abstract method implementation
  or
* Lambda expression using `DoubleBinaryOperator`

This replaces if-else / switch logic.

---

### 2. Centralized Validation Helper

```java id="y12a7k"
private void validateArithmeticOperands(Quantity<U> other, U targetUnit, boolean targetRequired)
```

Handles:

* Null operand checks
* Null target unit checks
* Category compatibility
* Finiteness validation
* Consistent error messages

Single source of truth for validation.

---

### 3. Centralized Arithmetic Helper

```java id="l82m1r"
private double performBaseArithmetic(Quantity<U> other, ArithmeticOperation operation)
```

Handles:

* Base-unit conversion
* Operation execution via enum
* Division-by-zero check
* Returns base-unit result

---

### 4. Refactored Public Methods

Public methods now delegate:

* add() → helper + conversion
* subtract() → helper + conversion
* divide() → helper only (returns scalar)

Each method is now shorter, clearer, and focused.

---

## Behavior Preservation

All UC12 behaviors remain unchanged:

* Cross-unit arithmetic
* Explicit & implicit target units
* Division returns dimensionless double
* Non-commutative subtraction & division
* Immutability preserved
* Rounding applied to add/subtract only
* Cross-category prevention intact

All UC12 test cases pass without modification.

---

## Architectural Improvements

* DRY principle fully enforced
* Single validation logic
* Single conversion logic
* Enum-based operation dispatch
* Reduced code duplication
* Cleaner method readability
* Scalable for future operations (Multiply, Modulo, etc.)
* Private helper encapsulation

---

## Scalability Validation

Adding a new operation now requires:

1. Add enum constant in `ArithmeticOperation`
2. No changes to validation
3. No duplication of conversion logic

Architecture now supports unlimited arithmetic extensions.

---

## UC14 — Temperature Measurement with Selective Arithmetic Support

### Branch: `feature/UC14-Temperature-Measurement`

---

## Objective

Extend the Quantity Measurement Application to support **Temperature Units** while preserving clean architecture and SOLID principles.

Unlike Length, Weight, and Volume, temperature does **not support full arithmetic operations**. This use case refactors the system to allow **selective arithmetic capability per measurement category**.

---

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Added TemperatureUnit Enum

Supported Units:

* CELSIUS
* FAHRENHEIT
* KELVIN

Implemented:

* Accurate non-linear conversion formulas
* Cross-unit equality
* Override for unsupported arithmetic operations

---

### 2. Refactored IMeasurable Interface

Enhanced interface with:

* Default methods for optional arithmetic support
* `validateOperationSupport()` method
* `supportsArithmetic()` capability check
* Functional Interface: `SupportsArithmetic`
* Lambda expressions for capability declaration

This ensures:

* Backward compatibility (UC1–UC13 remain unchanged)
* Interface Segregation Principle compliance
* Non-breaking interface evolution

---

### 3. Selective Arithmetic Support

| Category    | Addition | Subtraction | Division |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Length      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      |
| Weight      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      |
| Volume      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      |
| Temperature | ❌ No     | ❌ No        | ❌ No     |

Temperature operations now throw:

`UnsupportedOperationException`

With clear error messages.

---

### 4. Temperature Conversion Formulas

* °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
* °C = (°F − 32) × 5/9
* K = °C + 273.15

Edge cases handled:

* Absolute zero
* -40°C = -40°F
* Precision tolerance (epsilon-based equality)

---

## Architectural Improvements

* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Capability-based design
* Default methods in interfaces
* Lambda expressions
* Functional interfaces
* Non-linear unit conversion handling
* Polymorphic error messaging
* Generic type safety preserved

---

## Type Safety & Cross-Category Protection

Temperature cannot be compared with:

* Length
* Weight
* Volume

Generics + runtime checks prevent category mixing.

---

## Testing Coverage

* Cross-unit temperature equality
* Conversion accuracy
* Symmetry & transitive equality
* Unsupported operation validation
* Cross-category comparison prevention
* Backward compatibility with UC1–UC13
* Precision tolerance validation
* Edge case testing

All previous test cases pass without modification.

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Designing extensible generic systems
* Evolving interfaces safely
* Handling non-linear conversions
* Applying Interface Segregation Principle
* Capability-based API design
* Advanced enum behavior with lambdas
* Clean exception semantics
* Preserving backward compatibility in large systems
